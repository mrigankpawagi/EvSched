		<h1 class="center">A Novel Approach to Linear Scheduling using a Genetic Algorithm</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Job-scheduling has a wide variety of uses in many industries - the most obvious of which is optimizing
			resources to extract maximum output in minimum time. Such an application has been developed and implemented
			using several algorithms and has proven to be extremely effective in managing multiple parallel tasks - or
			jobs.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, this model cannot be directly adopted for scheduling day-to-day personal activities, particularly
			because of the fact that people - almost always - work linearly, i.e., perform one activity at a time. In
			fact, study has shown that single-tasking is much more productive than multitasking<sup data-cite=0></sup>,
			and can allow people to finish much more work despite taking up tasks in a sequential manner. This not only
			enhances the quality of work, but also minimizes productivity-related distress<sup data-cite=1></sup> for
			students and professionals, among other people.</p>
		<h2>
			Overview
		</h2>
		<p>A large fraction of people<sup data-cite=2></sup> finds it difficult to create a perfect schedule that works
			every single day. All the critical parameters that come into play – urgency, value, physical and mental
			commitment – are too complicated for the human mind to compute accurately, making it difficult for people to
			recognize their exact productivity patterns.</p>
		<p>To provide a mathematically sound solution to this everyday problem, I propose a new approach to linear
			scheduling that is developed specifically to cater to this need. This approach - called <b>EvSched</b> - is
			based on optimization through a genetic algorithm that has been elaborated on in this text.</p>
		<p>I have also developed a prototype called <a href="https://kronologue-ai.web.app">Kronologue</a> to
			demonstrate this technique. Kronologue boils down the process of effective scheduling to a few easy steps
			for the user, whose entire schedule is rearranged and optimized keeping in view their energy and efficiency
			curves, their priorities, their capacities, and their sensitivity to distractions. </p>
		<p>Kronologue has been able to produce schedules with as much as 99% greater productivity<sup
				data-cite=3></sup>.</p>
		<h2>
			Onboarding
		</h2>
		<p>First-time users are asked to provide a set of baseline data in order to begin using the scheduler based on
			EvSched. This data includes details about the user’s intended sleep pattern (including daytime naps) and
			details about their planned tasks for the day. Each task has a set of properties that have been detailed
			below.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Time</b>
				<p>The user is asked if their tasks have a strict timing, in which case they can simply enter
					this exact time interval. If the task has flexible timings, the user is asked for a preferred time
					interval during the day, along with a <i>Time Priority</i> - which measures the extent of
					rescheduling allowed for the task. The Time Priority of a task with strict timings is set as 100%.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Task Metrics</b>
				<p>
					The user is asked to provide the following four parameters for each task. These parameters are set
					on a scale<sup data-cite=4></sup> from 0 to 100%. They are are variable and their values can change
					over time based on the
					responses received from the user.
				<ul>
					<li><i>Mental Activity</i> - Mental effort required for the task.</li>
					<li><i>Physical Activity</i> - Physical effort required for the task.</li>
					<li><i>Urgency</i> - Degree of immediacy associated with the task.</li>
					<li><i>Value</i> - Importance of the task with respect to the user’s short- or long-term goals.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Optimization Parameters</b>
				<p>These parameters essentially play the role of weights in the core algorithm and are supposed to be
					determined over time by the program. However, the user is also given the option to enter initial
					values<sup data-cite=5></sup> into these parameters when the task is created for the first time.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Influence of the previous day's performance on the productivity of each task.
					</li>
					<li>Cumulative <i>Tiring Effect</i> caused by each task over time.</li>
					<li><i>Tiring Effect</i> caused each task per unit time (per minute).
					<li>Effect of tiredness on productivity in each task.</li>
					<li>Effect of mental and physical hindrances on productivity in each task.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>
			Sleep
		</h3>
		<p>Sleep is also treated like a task in this algorithm. However, it is processed separately and the typical
			metrics and parameters denote slightly different information in case of sleep. The user is required to enter
			the duration of their night sleep, and the maximum napping time they need over the day along with the
			minimum nap duration. The meanings of all the metrics and parameters in context of sleep have been described
			below.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Task Metrics</b>
				<p>In case of sleep,
				<ul>
					<li>Mental Activity is replaced by <i>Mental Influence</i> which measures how comfortable the sleep
						is.</li>
					<li>Physical Activity is replaced by <i>Physical Influence</i> which measures how rejuvenating the
						sleep is.</li>
					<li>There is no Urgency property.</li>

				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Optimization Parameters</b>
				<p>In case of sleep, the Tiring Effect is treated as the <i>Regenerating Effect</i> by giving it
					negative values for related parameters.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
