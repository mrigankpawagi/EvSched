		<h1 class="center">A Novel Approach to Linear Scheduling using a Genetic Algorithm</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Job-scheduling has a wide variety of uses in many industries - the most obvious of which is optimizing
			resources to extract maximum output in minimum time. Such an application has been developed and implemented
			using several algorithms and has proven to be extremely effective in managing multiple parallel tasks - or
			jobs.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, this model cannot be directly adopted for scheduling day-to-day personal activities, particularly
			because of the fact that people - almost always - work linearly, i.e., perform one activity at a time. In
			fact, study has shown that single-tasking is much more productive than multitasking<sup data-cite=0></sup>,
			and can allow people to finish much more work despite taking up tasks in a sequential manner. This not only
			enhances the quality of work, but also minimizes productivity-related distress<sup data-cite=1></sup> for
			students and professionals, among other people.</p>
		<h2>
			Overview
		</h2>
		<p>A large fraction of people<sup data-cite=2></sup> finds it difficult to create a perfect schedule that works
			every single day. All the critical parameters that come into play – urgency, value, physical and mental
			commitment – are too complicated for the human mind to compute accurately, making it difficult for people to
			recognize their exact productivity patterns.</p>
		<p>To provide a mathematically sound solution to this everyday problem, I propose a new approach to linear
			scheduling that is developed specifically to cater to this need. This approach - called <b>EvSched</b> - is
			based on optimization through a genetic algorithm that has been elaborated on in this text.</p>
		<p>I have also developed a prototype called <a href="https://kronologue-ai.web.app">Kronologue</a> to
			demonstrate this technique. Kronologue boils down the process of effective scheduling to a few easy steps
			for the user, whose entire schedule is rearranged and optimized keeping in view their energy and efficiency
			curves, their priorities, their capacities, and their sensitivity to distractions. </p>
		<p>Kronologue has been able to produce schedules with as much as 99% greater productivity<sup
				data-cite=3></sup>.</p>
		<h2>
			Onboarding
		</h2>
		<p>First-time users are asked to provide a set of baseline data in order to begin using the scheduler based on
			EvSched. This data includes details about the user’s intended sleep pattern (including daytime naps) and
			details about their planned tasks for the day. Each task has a set of properties that have been detailed
			below.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Time</b>
				<p>The user is asked if their tasks have a strict timing, in which case they can simply enter
					this exact time interval. If the task has flexible timings, the user is asked for a preferred time
					interval during the day, along with a <i>Time Priority</i> - which measures the extent of
					rescheduling allowed for the task. The Time Priority of a task with strict timings is set as 100%.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Task Metrics</b>
				<p>
					The user is asked to provide the following four parameters for each task. These parameters are set
					on a scale<sup data-cite=4></sup> from 0 to 100%. They are are variable and their values can change
					over time based on the
					responses received from the user.
				<ul>
					<li><i>Mental Activity</i> - Mental effort required for the task.</li>
					<li><i>Physical Activity</i> - Physical effort required for the task.</li>
					<li><i>Urgency</i> - Degree of immediacy associated with the task.</li>
					<li><i>Value</i> - Importance of the task with respect to the user’s short- or long-term goals.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Optimization Parameters</b>
				<p>These parameters essentially play the role of weights in the core algorithm and are supposed to be
					determined over time by the program. However, the user is also given the option to enter initial
					values<sup data-cite=5></sup> into these parameters when the task is created for the first time.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Influence of the previous day's performance on the productivity of each task.
					</li>
					<li>Cumulative <i>Tiring Effect</i> caused by each task over time.</li>
					<li><i>Tiring Effect</i> caused each task per unit time (per minute).
					<li>Effect of tiredness on productivity in each task.</li>
					<li>Effect of mental and physical hindrances on productivity in each task.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>
			Sleep
		</h3>
		<p>Sleep is also treated like a task in this algorithm. However, it is processed separately and the typical
			metrics and parameters denote slightly different information in case of sleep. The user is required to enter
			the duration of their night sleep, and the maximum napping time they need over the day along with the
			minimum nap duration. The meanings of all the metrics and parameters in context of sleep have been described
			below.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Task Metrics</b>
				<p>In case of sleep,
				<ul>
					<li>Mental Activity is replaced by <i>Mental Influence</i> which measures how comfortable the sleep
						is.</li>
					<li>Physical Activity is replaced by <i>Physical Influence</i> which measures how rejuvenating the
						sleep is.</li>
					<li>There is no Urgency property.</li>

				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Optimization Parameters</b>
				<p>In case of sleep, the Tiring Effect is treated as the <i>Regenerating Effect</i> by giving it
					negative values for related parameters.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Rationale for Choice of Metrics and Parameters</h2>
		<p>I conducted a detailed survey<sup data-cite=6></sup> of over 57 people to gather data about
		<ol>
			<li>the current methods that people use for scheduling their daily life.</li>
			<li>the success or failure of these methods.</li>
			<li>factors and trends that affect productivity on short-term and long term bases.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The survey respondents included both children and adults (ages 11 to 46) from different backgrounds, and
			comprised of 56% females and 44% males.</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			As much as 55% people have reported that they often find it difficult to manage their schedule; the most
			important reasons of low productivity are disturbed sleep (22%) and improper prioritization of tasks (86%).
			It could also be seen that although people are engaged in a lot of activity, they hardly use any
			productivity technique in their daily life (only 45% people are aware of these techniques). While I
			initially expected to find a ‘perfect’ time of the day or a ‘perfect’ workplace setting required for higher
			productivity, the survey revealed that even if this ‘perfect’ exists, it is not the same for every
			individual. In fact, even for a given individual, it can vary on different days. Thus, it became clear that
			we must adopt a personalized approach that can take into account daily and hourly variations in
			productivity, which in turn are based out of a variety of factors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sleep turned out to be a very important factor in productivity<sup data-cite=7></sup> – and thus it has been
			comprehensively taken
			into account by EvSched. Another important feature revealed by the survey was the abrupt transition
			between mental and physical activity in people with reportedly low productivities. Many people found it
			difficult to determine their maximum efficiency at mental or physical activity at any given time of the day,
			ending up exhausting themselves (mentally or physically) before completing all the planned tasks. Moreover,
			the urgency and the
			value of particular tasks often overrode existing plans for many people – leading to sudden breaks in
			productivity. This
			necessitates a method for examining urgency and value well in time, in order to prevent last-minute hassle
			and stress.
		</p>
		<p>

			I studied all the descriptive responses and gathered the factors that could be measured qualitatively and
			quantitatively. Many factors (like weather and eating habits, among others) examined in the survey
			ultimately turned out to be relatively less important for the purpose of scheduling, and were thus not taken
			into account while creating EvSched.
		</p>
		<h2>Preparing the Base</h2>
		<p>
			This algorithm works on a 2-dimensional matrix where one axis contains 1440 rows<sup data-cite=9></sup> to
			represent each minute<sup data-cite=8></sup> of the day, and the other axis contains 11 columns that contain
			all the information about the task occurring at any particular minute. The conversion of data received from
			the user (and from the database) to this Task Matrix is done before the optimization begins.
		</p>
		<p>In additional to the parameters discussed before, each row contains an additional property called
			<i>Cumulative Duration</i>. This is a count of the number of minutes spent in the activity <u>up to the
				concerned minute</u>.
			Also, before being optimized, the Schedule contains each task at the time preferred by the user. This
			schedule is later modified during optimization.
		</p>
		<h2>Plots</h2>
		<p>This algorithm can be best visualized through plots created for different aspects of scheduling. A
			<i>Plot</i> in this context is a 1-dimensional Data-series with 1440 elements denoting a specific
			property of each of the 1440 minutes of the day. If <i>plotted</i> on a graph, it will appear in the
			below format. Details about each plot generated by the algorithm have been discussed in the following text.

		<blockquote>
			A metric that can be seen in several of the below plots is the Previous Day metric. This is a measure of the productivity of the user at each minute of the day in the past. This too is stored like a Plot, but is not directly processed like the plots mentioned below.
